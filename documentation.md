# E++
## Getting to know it.
E++ has some basic syntax.
Start with this line of code.

> log('Hello world!')

This introduces the **debugging statement**, *log*.

You don't have to match the quotation marks, so
> log('Hey!")

would be fine.

Commenting is easy.

> % Hey! This is a **comment!** %

## Variables
There are ~~two~~ **three** basic types of variables.

- Strings
- Numbers
- Booleans

### Strings
Strings are made with *'* or *"* enclosing a *string* of letters, no pun intended.

EX:
> var str main = 'hey'

### Numbers
Numbers are made with **digits 0-9**, and **decimals**.

Examples of numbers are:

> var num f = 1
> f# + 1
> OUTPUT: 2.0

***WARNING! IF YOU WANT TO REFERENCE/USE ARITHMETIC ON A VARIABLE, PUT A SHARP SIGN AFTER IT UNLESS YOU'RE IN A LOG STATEMENT.***

### Booleans
Booleans are TRUE or FALSE. They currently have no use, so don't use them.

EX:
> var bool tru = true
> var bool fals = false

You get the idea.

Thats all.
